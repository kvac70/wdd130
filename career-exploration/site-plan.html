      <h3>Your Career Options</h3>
      <p>
        There are many options for career paths. The difficult part is finding the one that suits you and your interests. No one wants to consigned to what I refer to as endless woe. Endless woe is the state of a man or woman's soul within their occupational life where they begin to lose interest in their profession and, as a result, their job becomes rather bland. No one wants a bland job. More often than not, this lack of excitement will ooze into other parts of their life too (family life, recreation, times of leisure). So ... Let's explore out options! Because there are so many options, however, many paths will not be represented here, but what we've provided gives a good spread for our purpose.

      <h3>Finding Your Career</h3>
      <p>
        Now that you have found something that interests you, we want to start to narrow things down. Again, when it comes to this sort of thing we will not be able to identify all the possible career options for you but we sure can call upon other resources for some help in our efforts. Here we provide you with suggestions to take career compatibility tests, read educational articles that are informative in terms of what is expected of a person working in the workforce. In addition, we've done our best to provide real world advice from folks that may have navigated similar challenges as the ones that brought you here. Please, roam around a while. We hope you find something that will present you with great future possibilities.

What are options for your next steps. So now what? We've absorbed all this information and now it's time to apply, but how do we move forward? It is important to weigh out your possibilities that we've discussed before. After doing that, you should do some research to look into local job opportunities within your field of choice. If you are lacking the educational prerequisites, then it will be necessary for you to find a means by which you can receive the proper training. There may be many ways in which this can be done. Maybe in a university class setting or an infield training opportunity. We can't give you all the answers but you must know that it's game time now and the search is on.
